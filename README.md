# The Blue Report

The Blue Report is a website that shows trending links on Bluesky over the previous 24 hours. Links are scored based on the number of posts, reposts, and likes that reference them.

This repository is changing quickly. I intend to write a more comprehensive README once the dust has settled â€“ thanks for your patience!

If you have any questions, please [reach out to me on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/george.black)!
